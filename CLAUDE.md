# CLAUDE.md

This file exists so Claude Code (and other coding agents) pick up the project's
guidance automatically. To keep a **single source of truth**, it does not repeat
that guidance — it points at it.

## Read these, in order

1. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — what the project is, the commands, the green gate,
   and the house rules. **Start here.**
2. [`AGENTS/`](AGENTS/architecture.md) — operational detail:
   [architecture](AGENTS/architecture.md),
   [conventions](AGENTS/conventions.md),
   [testing](AGENTS/testing.md), and the [glossary](AGENTS/glossary.md).
3. [`spec/index.md`](spec/index.md) — the **living specifications**, which are
   the source of truth for behaviour. Code and spec must not drift; when they
   disagree, reconcile them.
4. [`plan.md`](plan.md) and [`tasks.md`](tasks.md) — the phased plan with the
   decision log, and the ordered task list to work through.

## The one rule that matters most

Keep the crate **green** before considering any task done:

```sh
cargo build --all-targets
cargo test                                    # unit tests + doctests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings     # zero warnings (pedantic is on)
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps
```

Everything else — the conventions, the transformation algorithm, the task
ordering, the release checklist — lives in the documents linked above.
