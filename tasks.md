# fhirpg tasks

Work breakdown for the plan's milestones. Each task lists its acceptance
criterion. Order within a milestone is roughly dependency order.

## M1 — Engine proven (R5 vertical slice)

- [x] **T1 Workspace scaffold.** Cargo workspace per plan D14
  (`fhirpg-map`, `fhirpg-gen`, `fhirpg-store`, `fhirpg` — the server crate
  arrives with M4), CI (fmt, clippy, test, live-PG job).
  *Done:* `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; tests self-skip without inputs.
- [x] **T2 Spec-package ingestion.** profiles-resources.json +
  profiles-types.json parsed directly (simpler than reusing the fhir
  crate's parser; that crate still backs `--validate` later) into element
  trees with cardinality, types, choice and contentReference info — for all
  three versions, not just R5. SearchParameters ingestion moves to M3.
- [x] **T3 Relational map format.** `fhirpg-map::model`: node arena (cycles
  via indexes), tables, typed columns, choice variants, reference splits,
  extension/spill channels, 63-byte registry with deterministic
  abbreviation + hash fallback. Assets: `assets/fhirpg-relmap-{r3,r4,r5}
  .json.gz` + CHECKSUMS.txt.
- [x] **T4 DDL generator + scale spike.** Full R5 = 7,355 tables installs
  in 9.5 s via staged-schema + rename (single-transaction DDL exhausts
  PostgreSQL's lock budget — G2.5 amended). Numbers in doc/benchmarks.md;
  risk R1 retired. *Remaining for M3:* search indexes; value-set CHECKs
  (M3.7) not yet emitted.
- [x] **T5 Shredder.** Generic walker: scalars, ords-array child tables,
  choices (incl. force-split wide choices), reference parsing, extension
  leaf rows, primitive extensions with null-padded arrays, element ids,
  contained, type-cycle spill, unknown-element rejection.
- [x] **T6 Reconstructor.** Inverse walker with consumption auditing (every
  row must be used exactly once — gaps surface as integrity errors, never
  silent loss). *Accept exceeded:* the entire three-version corpus
  (7,399 examples) round-trips in memory.
- [x] **T7 Store layer: init/load/read.** tokio-postgres + deadpool;
  transactional put with history append; pipelined multi-table reads;
  chunked multi-row inserts; text-image wire protocol with explicit casts.
  *Accept:* full-corpus live round trip 7,396/7,396 across r3/r4/r5;
  bulk benchmark: 6,146 res/s load, 1.18 ms reads (doc/benchmarks.md).
- [x] **T8 CLI v1.** `gen`, `init`, `load` (NDJSON/Bundle/single, gzip,
  content-detection, per-resource error reporting, nonzero exit), `get`,
  `delete`, `export`, `transform`. *Remaining:* streaming (bounded-memory)
  reads for multi-GB NDJSON — currently whole-file.
- [x] **T9 Round-trip property tests.** Map-driven random-resource
  generator (deterministic SplitMix64 seeds — no proptest dependency):
  deep recursion, sparse primitive arrays with extensions, nested
  extensions, choice variants, decimals, partial dates. 10k cases pass
  (`FHIRPG_PROPTEST_CASES`; default 500 locally).
  *Found a real bug the 7,399-example corpus missed:* two cyclic
  contentReferences into one table (QuestionnaireResponse `item.item` +
  `item.answer.item`) made ordinal paths ambiguous — fixed with ordinal
  sign lanes (`Elem::neg_lane`); the reconstructor's consumption audit is
  what caught it.

## M2 — History + CRUD semantics

- [x] **T10 version_id + history tables.** H5.1–H5.3 in the store:
  history append on C/U/D, soft delete, `vread`, `history`, and `status`
  (the 404-vs-410 distinction); version numbering continues past deletes
  (derived from history max, not the base row).
  *Accept met:* m2_semantics integration test — create→update→delete shows
  D/U/C history, vread of each version matches, deleted reads as Deleted.
- [x] **T11 Optimistic concurrency.** `put_if(resource, expected_version)`
  under FOR UPDATE row locks; `StoreError::Conflict` for the API's 412;
  expected 0 = create-only (If-None-Exist shape). *Accept met:* two racing
  conditional writers — exactly one wins.
- [x] **T12 fhirpg_meta + idempotent init.** Staged-schema install +
  atomic rename, checksum recorded; re-init no-ops on matching checksum
  and refuses a mismatch. Chunked `drop_schema` + `fhirpg drop --yes`.
  *Accept met* in m2_semantics.

## M3 — Search

- [x] **T13 Search-parameter compiler.** FHIRPath subset (unions, casts
  `ofType`/`as`, lenient `where(resolve())`) resolved by walking the map
  tree; targets embedded in the map assets per resource; every uncompiled
  parameter carries its reason (`SearchDef::note`).
  *Accept met:* 94.8% of R5's 1,972 parameters compiled (1,870); the
  remainder are composite/special and exists()-style expressions.
- [~] **T14 Query builder + result params.** Done: `Store::search` — AND
  across params, OR across values and targets, all user input bound (no SQL
  interpolation), modifiers :exact/:contains, token system|code, date
  prefixes with precision ranges + Period overlap, quantity value|system|
  code, reference forms, `_id`, `_lastUpdated`, `_count`/offset; strict
  unsupported-parameter errors; `fhirpg search` CLI; `_sort` (base-table
  params + _id/_lastUpdated, honest errors otherwise) and
  `_total=accurate`. *Accept mostly met:* search_semantics + rest suites
  green against live PG. Single-hop `_include` (via compiled reference
  targets) and `_revinclude` (via the search machinery) with
  search.mode=include entries and dangling-reference tolerance.
  *Remaining:* chained `reference.`, cursor paging, lenient handling.
- [x] **T15 Index emission + explain audit.** One index per distinct
  search-target column set emitted with the DDL (R5: 1,813 indexes; full
  init 5.8 s). EXPLAIN audit in tests/bench.rs: token/reference/date
  searches all plan index scans at 100k resources; the test fails on seq
  scans. *Note:* ILIKE-prefix string search bypasses btree — revisit with
  text_pattern_ops if profiles demand.

## M4 — REST server

- [x] **T16 axum skeleton.** `fhirpg-server` crate + `fhirpg serve`:
  versioned base paths, application/fhir+json, 32 MiB body limit,
  OperationOutcome error mapping (400/404/410/412/501/500 with opaque
  internals), /health + /ready. *Accept met* in the rest integration
  suite. *Remaining:* request ids, graceful-shutdown wiring (M6).
- [x] **T17 Full CRUD + history endpoints.** create (server-assigned ids,
  Location + ETag), read (404 vs 410), update with If-Match → 412, delete
  (idempotent 204), instance history bundle, vread.
  *Accept met:* §7 rest suite green, including If-None-Exist conditional
  create (0 → create, 1 → 200 with the match, many → 412).
  *Remaining:* conditional delete-by-search.
- [x] **T18 Search over HTTP.** GET + POST `_search` (query + form
  merged), searchset bundles with fullUrl, self/next links; next-link
  paging verified by walking it in the test. `_count` capped at 1000;
  unimplemented result params answer 501 rather than lying.
- [x] **T19 Batch/transaction.** Batch: independent entries (GET read,
  POST, PUT, DELETE) with per-entry statuses. Transaction: DELETE→POST→PUT
  ordering, urn:uuid reference rewriting (JSON-walk, whole-string match),
  single database transaction via `Store::transact`.
  *Accept met:* urn resolution verified end-to-end; poison-entry
  transaction provably rolls back. *Remaining:* GET entries inside
  transactions, conditional references.
- [x] **T20 CapabilityStatement generation.** Generated per version from
  the map + compiled search params (only supported params listed) — never
  hand-edited. *Remaining:* touchstone-style external validation (M6).

## M5 — R4 and R3

> **Ledger drift, needs a human call.** T21 and T22 are unchecked, but T7
> records a full-corpus live round trip of 7,396/7,396 across r3/r4/r5, the
> README claims all three corpora round-trip losslessly, and `fhirpg serve`
> mounts all three (T23, checked). Either the boxes are stale or the README
> overstates. Since the spec is meant to be the source of truth, reconcile
> before release rather than after.

- [ ] **T21 R4 artifacts.** Run generator on 4.0.1; fix spec-parsing deltas.
  *Accept:* full R4 examples corpus round-trips live; REST suite green on
  `/r4`.
- [ ] **T22 R3 artifacts.** Same for 3.0.2.
  *Accept:* full R3 examples corpus round-trips live; REST suite green on
  `/r3`.
- [x] **T23 Multi-version serve.** `fhirpg serve` mounts every version
  whose assets exist and whose schema is installed; per-version capability
  statements. *Verified:* one process serving r3 + r4 + r5, curl-checked.

## M6 — Production hardening

- [x] **T-validate (V9.2).** `fhirpg load --validate` deserializes each
  resource through the typed `fhir` crate model behind the `validate`
  build feature. **All three versions**, since `fhir` 1.2.1.
  *The upstream bug is fixed and released:* published 1.2.0 could not compile
  its own r3/r4 features — the `Validate` derive expanded to `crate::r5::`
  paths — but only for crates.io consumers, since the repository resolves the
  derive macro through its `path` dependency where the fix already lived. It
  needed `fhir-derive-macros` 1.0.1 published alongside `fhir` 1.2.1; a
  `fhir` release on its own would have pulled the same broken macro.
  *Accept met:* `validate_tests` covers R3/R4/R5 and records the one thing
  `--validate` does not catch (unknown elements — serde ignores them; the
  shredder rejects them per D12).
- [x] **T-graceful.** `fhirpg serve` shuts down cleanly on SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- [~] **T24 Observability.** Done: /health, /ready, /metrics (Prometheus
  text: request/response-class/latency counters), X-Request-Id
  (propagated or generated) with per-request tracing that logs
  method/path/status only — never resource content. *Remaining:* JSON log
  format wiring in the CLI, an automated redaction test, latency
  histogram buckets.
- [~] **T25 Pool + timeout hardening.** Done: server-side
  statement_timeout (FHIRPG_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS, default 30 s), pool
  wait timeout 2 s, exhaustion → 503 + Retry-After.
  *Remaining:* an automated saturation test.
- [x] **T26 Migrations + upgrade.** `init` stores the map asset in
  fhirpg_meta; `init --upgrade` diffs installed vs current maps and
  applies additive DDL (new tables/columns/indexes) in lock-safe chunks;
  destructive steps refuse without --allow-destructive; column type
  changes always demand manual migration. *Accept met:* upgrade test —
  reduced install upgrades to full, data survives, re-upgrade no-ops,
  downgrade guarded then forced.
- [x] **T27 TLS feature + bind guard.** rustls in-process behind the
  `tls` feature (`serve --tls-cert/--tls-key`, axum-server) with graceful
  shutdown; loopback-default binding (an explicit --bind is the
  non-loopback acknowledgement). *Verified:* live HTTPS smoke test
  (HTTP/2, CapabilityStatement served, clean SIGTERM shutdown).
- [~] **T28 Benchmarks + regression gate.** Done: gated bench harness
  (load throughput, read latency, EXPLAIN audit) + doc/benchmarks.md with
  measured numbers (6,146 res/s; 1.18 ms reads at 100k).
  *Remaining:* CI regression gate against a recorded baseline; comparison
  against the historical jsonb implementation.
- [x] **T29 Book + generated schema docs.** mdBook (9 chapters:
  introduction, getting started, storage model, SQL querying, search,
  REST API, versions, operations, architecture); builds locally and in
  CI. Column/table→FHIR-path mapping ships inside the map assets
  themselves. *Remaining nicety:* a rendered path→table index page.
- [~] **T30 Security review + release.** Done: LICENSE-MIT/APACHE,
  CHANGELOG, publish metadata (versioned internal deps, keywords), map
  assets embedded in the binary so `cargo install fhirpg` is
  self-contained, `cargo publish --dry-run` clean for the leaf crate.
  *Remaining (human decisions):* pick the release version, publish the
  five crates in dependency order, tag; optionally add cargo-audit/deny
  to CI.

## M7 — Trustworthy under load and under audit

The gap between "works end to end" and "may hold patient data". Ordered by
severity: P0 items are defects in what already ships, P1 items are missing
guarantees, P2 items are reach.

### P0 — defects in shipped behaviour

- [x] **T31 Snapshot reads (R4.5).** `Store::get` reads the base row and
  every child table as separate implicit transactions
  (`fhirpg-store/src/lib.rs:554`), while `put_in` deletes and re-inserts
  (`:512`). A write landing mid-read reconstructs a resource that never
  existed. Wrap every multi-statement read in one
  `REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY` transaction; same for `export` and search
  materialization.
  *Accept:* a reader loop against a writer loop over 10k iterations never
  observes a torn resource and never errors (T11.6).
- [x] **T32 Encrypted database transport (O10.7).** `NoTls` is hard-coded
  (`fhirpg-store/src/lib.rs:186`), so PHI crosses to PostgreSQL in clear and
  `sslmode=require` cannot be honored. Add `tokio-postgres-rustls`, honor
  `sslmode`/`PGSSLROOTCERT`, default `prefer`, and refuse a non-loopback
  `--bind` over an unencrypted connection without `--allow-insecure-db`.
  *Done:* `SslPolicy`, rustls connector, `PGSSLROOTCERT` trust anchors,
  `Store::connect_with`, the `serve` startup guard, and a startup warning
  whenever the link is unencrypted. fhirpg's `require` validates the
  certificate where libpq's does not — a documented deviation, in the safe
  direction. The startup refusal is now split out as `refuse_insecure_db`
  and tested as a policy table (`startup_guard_tests`), including the case
  where the bind will not resolve — "I could not tell" must count as
  not-loopback, or the check silently skips itself.
  The live test against a TLS-only PostgreSQL now runs in CI
  (`ci.yml`, `tls-database`): a `hostssl`-only server, with a step that first
  proves plaintext really is refused — a gate that silently permits downgrade
  tests nothing — then runs the live suite with `PGSSLMODE=require` and the
  self-signed certificate as its own trust anchor.

  *Remaining:* nothing on GitHub. There is no Woodpecker counterpart, because
  Woodpecker starts services before workspace steps run, so a certificate
  generated in a step does not exist when the database container boots; the
  workarounds (a committed test key, or docker-in-docker) are each worse than
  the gap. Recorded in `doc/ci.md` rather than left to be discovered.
- [x] **T33 Atomic conditional interactions (A7.10).** `If-None-Exist`
  searches then writes (`fhirpg-server/src/lib.rs:444`); two concurrent
  identical conditional creates both create. Move match and write into one
  transaction guarded by `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on the criteria hash; same
  for conditional delete and conditional update.
  *Done:* `Store::conditional_create`/`conditional_delete` take
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on a sorted hash of the criteria, then match and
  write in one transaction. *Accept met:* 8 racing conditional creates yield
  exactly one resource and seven `Existing`. *Remaining:* conditional update
  (the server does not implement it yet).
- [x] **T34 Audit envelope on history (M3.15, PR12.1–PR12.4).** History
  records no actor at all. Add the audit columns to the generated history
  DDL, thread a `Principal` through the store write path, and extract it
  from the configured trusted header behind `--trust-proxy`. Additive, so
  `init --upgrade` migrates existing installs.
  *Done:* `Audit` envelope threaded through `put_audited`/`delete_audited`/
  `transact_audited`/`conditional_*_audited`; `PrincipalPolicy` on the
  server honoring a configured header **only** behind `--trust-proxy`;
  `--require-principal` → 401; CLI writes attributed to the operator
  (`Audit::cli()`). Upgrade reconciles the new columns idempotently.
  *Accept met:* the `audit` suite asserts all three, and that a plain `put`
  records `unauthenticated` rather than nothing.
- [x] **T35 Configured service base URL (A7.7).** Bundle `fullUrl` and
  `link` are built from the `Host` header and hard-coded `http://`
  (`fhirpg-server/src/lib.rs:739`). Add `--base-url`, honor forwarded
  headers only under `--trust-proxy` with a host allowlist.
  *Done:* `BaseUrl` with `--base-url`, `--trust-proxy`, `--allowed-host`;
  the default emits URLs for the address actually bound and reads no request
  header at all. *Remaining:* a test asserting a poisoned `Host` changes
  nothing.
- [x] **T36 Preconditions inside bundles (A7.9).** `parse_entries`
  (`:888`) ignores `ifMatch`/`ifNoneExist`/`ifModifiedSince`. Honor them, or
  fail the entry 501 — never accept-and-ignore. *Done:* `ifMatch` is honored
  in batch and transaction entries (412 on mismatch, mapped as 412 rather
  than a generic 400); `ifNoneExist`/`ifModifiedSince`/`ifNoneMatch` fail the
  entry 501, and fail the whole bundle for a transaction.
- [x] **T37 Reference rewriting precision.** `rewrite_refs` (`:1130`)
  replaces any string equal to a `urn:uuid`, including narrative and
  `valueString`. Restrict to `Reference.reference` values and
  `Bundle.entry.fullUrl`. *Done:* only `reference` keys are rewritten.
- [x] **T38 Resource id validation (R4.6).** No `[A-Za-z0-9\-\.]{1,64}`
  check anywhere; ids from URL or body land in unbounded `text`.
  *Done:* `valid_fhir_id` guards read, vread, history, update, delete, and
  Bundle entry urls. *Remaining:* the same check inside `fhirpg load`.
- [x] **T39 PHI response headers (A7.8).** `Cache-Control: no-store`,
  `Pragma: no-cache`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`; CORS
  denied unless `--cors-origin` names an origin. *Done:* the four headers are
  set on every response. *Remaining:* `--cors-origin` (there is still no CORS
  layer at all, which is closed rather than open).
- [x] **T40 Diagnostics hygiene (A7.11).** `StoreError::Other` text is
  reflected verbatim into OperationOutcomes (`:174`). Client-visible
  diagnostics become path + rule id; detail goes to the log with the
  incident id. *Done:* `StoreError` now distinguishes `Unsupported`
  (client-safe: names the caller's own parameter) from `Other` (internal:
  logged behind an incident id, never returned). Search-compilation errors
  are `Unsupported`, so the honest "this parameter is not supported"
  messages survive.

### P1 — missing guarantees

- [x] **T41 Access log (PR12.5, PR12.6).** `fhirpg_access_log` per schema;
  every read, vread, history, and search appends a record naming the actor,
  the subject, and (for search) how many resources were disclosed.
  `--audit-mode sync|async|off`, bounded queue, fail closed on saturation,
  per-version counters, `--allow-unaudited` to opt out loudly.

  *On the default.* The spec draft had `async` as the default for
  throughput; it ships as `sync`. The failure `sync` prevents is the one
  that cannot be repaired afterwards — a disclosure with no record is
  indistinguishable, later, from a disclosure that never happened — and a
  fast default would make every deployment silently accept a loss window it
  never chose. `async` announces that window at startup.

  *Fail closed became real, not aspirational.* Recording used to be
  best-effort: a failed insert was logged and the read served anyway. Now
  `audit_read` returns a refusal that the four read paths propagate as 503,
  so in every mode a disclosure that cannot be recorded is not made.

  *Two bugs worth remembering, both in code that compiled and looked right.*
  `Sender::closed()` waits for the *receiver* to drop, so using it to
  shut the writer down deadlocks against the task it is waiting for; the
  sender has to actually be dropped, which means holding it somewhere
  takeable. And a queue-depth gauge maintained by read-then-subtract can
  underflow under concurrency, so depth is derived from the monotonic
  counters instead — an audit queue reporting a nonsense depth is worse than
  one reporting none. `tests/audit_async.rs` pins both, the drain test under
  a timeout so a deadlock fails instead of hanging the suite.

- [x] **T42 Tamper-evident history (M3.16, M3.17).** `prev_hash`/`row_hash`
  chain per resource id, `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` reject triggers,
  `fhirpg verify-audit` walking every chain, and the documented `REVOKE`
  grants. *Done:* all of it. The chain is computed **in SQL** so it covers
  the database's own `now()` and cannot race the read of the previous hash,
  and it hashes `resource::jsonb::text` — the stored normalized form — since
  hashing the submitted text would fail verification against what was
  actually saved. *Accept met:* the `audit` suite tampers with a history row
  behind the application's back and the chain names exactly that version.
- [x] **T43 Worldwide string search (P6.6).** Each string search target
  column gets a `_norm` companion holding the folded value, computed in Rust
  at write time; prefix search is a range predicate against it. Closes T15's
  unindexed-prefix note. No PostgreSQL extension required.

  *Two traps, both found by measurement rather than reasoning.*

  First: the cheap-looking version — an expression index on `fhirpg_norm(col)`
  plus a predicate `fhirpg_norm(col) LIKE fhirpg_norm($1) || '%'` — **does not
  use the index**. PostgreSQL's btree prefix optimization for `LIKE` needs a
  *constant* pattern, and `fhirpg_norm($1)` is only stable, not constant.
  Folding the term in Rust instead keeps the pattern constant, but then the
  fold exists twice — once in Rust, once in SQL — and the two must agree for
  every codepoint, forever, or a patient is simply not found. So the fold
  lives in Rust only (`fhirpg-map::fold`), and the database stores its output.

  Second, and the reason the first fix is not enough: even against a plain
  column with a `text_pattern_ops` index, `col LIKE $1` **still** scans. The
  prefix is extracted at plan time, so a custom plan (which substitutes
  parameter values) uses the index and a generic plan does not — meaning the
  query is fast in every hand-run `EXPLAIN` with a literal, fast for its first
  few executions, and then quietly degrades once PostgreSQL switches to the
  generic plan. The fix is to stop asking the planner to analyze a pattern at
  all: compute the upper bound in Rust and emit `col >= $1 AND col < $2`, an
  ordinary index condition. `tests/search_semantics.rs::string_prefix_search_uses_its_index`
  pins this with `plan_cache_mode = force_generic_plan`, which is the only
  setting under which the old form visibly fails.

  Ordering is by `COLLATE "C"` — set on the column itself — because the range
  bound is only sound under codepoint order. Under a linguistic collation a
  string beginning with the prefix can sort past the computed upper bound.

  `:exact` deliberately compares the *stored* column: it is defined as the
  literal string, so folding must not leak into it.

  Migration: `upgrade` adds the columns, then backfills them
  (`Store::backfill_norm`) before returning. Without the backfill an upgraded
  install would answer string searches from NULL columns and silently return
  fewer results — the one failure mode a clinical search must not have. The
  backfill folds distinct *values* rather than rows, in batches, and is
  resumable, since each pass only looks at rows still NULL.

- [x] **T44 Edge resource limits (O10.8, P6.7).** Per-request timeout,
  concurrency limit, in-flight cap, configurable pool size; batched result
  materialization instead of one `get` per id; `_include`/`_revinclude` caps
  that warn in the bundle when they truncate. Every ceiling is now a flag —
  `--request-timeout`, `--max-concurrent`, `--max-body-mb`, `--max-count`,
  `--max-included`, `--pool-size` — rather than a constant compiled into the
  binary, because the right value depends on the deployment and the previous
  answer was "rebuild it".

  `--pool-size` takes precedence over `FHIRPG_POOL_SIZE`: a flag the operator
  typed should not be silently overridden by an environment variable they
  inherited.

  `tests/edge_limits.rs` asserts a configured ceiling is *enforced*, not just
  parsed. A limit that reaches the config struct but never reaches the code
  that should apply it is worse than no limit, because the operator believes
  a ceiling exists.
- [x] **T45 Admin plane separation (O10.9).** `--admin-bind` for
  `/metrics`, `/health`, `/ready`; latency as a histogram so p99 is
  answerable. *Done:* `--admin-bind` serves /health, /ready and /metrics on
  their own address against the same counters, on their own task so they
  answer while the API is shedding load, and latency is a Prometheus
  histogram (`fhirpg_request_latency_seconds`, default 1ms–10s buckets) so
  `histogram_quantile` answers p99. A running total plus a count gives only
  the mean, and the mean cannot tell "every request took 40ms" from "99%
  took 5ms and 1% took 4 seconds" — which is the case anyone is paged for.
- [x] **T46 Honest CapabilityStatement (A7.12).** Declare
  `conditionalCreate`/`Update`/`Delete`, `searchInclude`, `searchRevInclude`,
  `readHistory`, `versioning`, and the `security` block; drop interactions
  that are not implemented. *Done:* per-resource `versioning`, `readHistory`,
  `updateCreate`, `conditionalCreate`/`Update`/`Delete`, `referencePolicy`,
  `searchInclude`/`RevInclude`; system-level `transaction` and `batch`; and a
  `security.description` stating plainly that fhirpg verifies no identity.
- [x] **T47 Supply-chain evidence (O10.10).** `cargo deny` + `cargo audit`
  in CI, CycloneDX SBOM per release, checksums for published artifacts.
  *Done:* a `supply-chain` CI job (cargo-deny + CycloneDX, SBOM uploaded as
  an artifact) and a `deny.toml` policy — permissive licences only, wildcards
  denied, unknown registries denied. *Remaining:* per-binary checksums in the
  release workflow.
- [x] **T48 Concurrency, redaction, and audit test suites (T11.6–T11.8).**
  The adversarial tests that keep T31–T42 honest. *Done:* `concurrency.rs`
  covers torn reads, racing conditional creates, and racing `If-Match`
  updates (T11.6); `redaction.rs` covers T11.7; `audit.rs` covers T11.8 —
  the audit envelope, the disclosure record, chain verification, and the
  database refusing to let history be rewritten. `audit_async.rs` adds the
  async path: batching, the shutdown drain, and saturation refusing rather
  than dropping.
- [x] **T49 Erasure (M3.18).** `fhirpg purge` with tombstone rows,
  `--allow-erasure`, and a test that `verify-audit` reports a purge as a
  recorded hole rather than a chain break. *Done:* `Store::purge` and
  `fhirpg purge`, the tombstone carrying who/when/why plus the terminated
  chain hash, and the append-only trigger relaxed to permit `DELETE` only
  inside a transaction that sets `fhirpg.erasure`. The book states the two
  limits plainly: backups and replicas are outside this, and the guard stops
  accidents rather than the application itself.
- [x] **T50 Trust-boundary chapter (PR12.8).** One table in the book: what
  fhirpg guarantees, what the perimeter must provide, what neither does yet.
  *Done:* `book/src/trust-boundary.md`, including a worked `serve`
  invocation where every flag is explained, the `REVOKE` grants, and an
  honest statement of what the hash chain does *not* prove (an attacker who
  can recompute it — hence: ship `row_hash` off-box).

### P2 — reach

- [ ] **T51 Type- and system-level `_history`.** Required for CDC,
  replication, and incremental export; currently instance-level only.
- [ ] **T52 Bulk Data `$export`.** Async kickoff, NDJSON output, status
  polling — ONC/HTI expects it, and the earlier fhirpg had the client half.
- [ ] **T53 `X-Provenance` and `AuditEvent` projection (PR12.7).** Store
  submitted Provenance; expose the access log as queryable `AuditEvent`.
- [ ] **T54 Inferno / Touchstone conformance run.** External validation of
  §7 and A7.12 against the published test kits.
- [ ] **T55 `_summary` and `_elements`.** Common in production clients;
  currently 501.
- [ ] **T56 PATCH.** JSON Patch and FHIRPath Patch, declared in the
  CapabilityStatement.
- [ ] **T57 Restore and failover drills.** A documented, tested PITR
  restore and a `fhirpg fsck` that checks orphan rows, ordinal gaps, and
  history/current agreement.
- [x] **T58 CI/CD on GitHub and Codeberg.** Parallel pipelines on both
  forges (`.github/workflows/`, `.woodpecker/`): fmt, clippy, unit tests,
  book, live-PostgreSQL suite, advisories/licenses/SBOM. Tag builds
  artifacts with checksums and a CycloneDX SBOM attached to the release;
  crates.io publishing is manual and confirmation-gated, since a published
  version can be yanked but never replaced. Also verifies the declared MSRV,
  which until now was a claim nothing checked. See `doc/ci.md`.
