//! The tamper-evidence hash chain, computed in this process (spec M3.16,
//! M3.16a).
//!
//! # Why not in the database
//!
//! Earlier versions computed these digests in SQL, inside the same statement
//! that inserted the row. That bought two real properties — the hashed
//! timestamp was the database's own `now()`, and the read of the previous
//! digest could not race the insert — and cost something more important.
//!
//! The digests are **unkeyed** and their pre-image format is public. Any
//! party who can write SQL can therefore also produce a correct digest for
//! whatever they wrote. Keeping the computation inside the database puts the
//! means of forgery in the same place as the data being forged, and
//! forecloses the only fix: a **keyed** digest (a MAC) whose key the database
//! never holds. A key stored where the attacker already has write access
//! protects nothing.
//!
//! So the honest statement of what this buys today, unkeyed:
//!
//! - It detects **careless or unaware modification** — a migration, a stray
//!   `UPDATE`, a restored-from-the-wrong-backup row.
//! - It supports an **external witness**: record the chain head somewhere the
//!   database cannot reach, and truncation or wholesale rewriting becomes
//!   detectable even against an attacker who can recompute digests.
//!
//! It does **not** by itself stop an attacker with SQL write access who knows
//! the format. That is what the **keyed** mode below is for.
//!
//! # Keyed mode (the actual fix)
//!
//! With `FHIRPG_CHAIN_KEY` set, each link is an HMAC rather than a bare hash:
//! `HMAC-SHA-256` and `HMAC-SHA3-256`, both FIPS-approved constructions
//! (198-1 over 180-4 and 202). The key lives in this process — from the
//! environment, or a file the database role cannot read — and is **never**
//! written to the database, never logged, and never sent in a query.
//!
//! That is the whole point. An attacker with SQL write access can rewrite any
//! row, but cannot produce a digest that verifies, because forging one
//! requires a secret that is not in the place they broke into. Storing the
//! key in the database would return the design to where it started.
//!
//! Each row records the **key id** that signed it, so keys can rotate without
//! invalidating history, and so a verifier can say *"signed with k2, which I
//! do not have"* — which is not the same claim as *"this row was tampered
//! with"*, and must never be reported as if it were.
//!
//! # Keeping the two lost properties
//!
//! Both survive without SQL-side hashing:
//!
//! - The timestamp is still the database's. It is read with `now()` in the
//!   same transaction and written back verbatim, so the value hashed is the
//!   value stored.
//! - The read of the previous digest still cannot race, because the write
//!   path already holds a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` row lock on the base row for
//!   this resource id before it appends history.
