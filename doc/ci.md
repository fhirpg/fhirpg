# Continuous integration and delivery

fhirpg is mirrored on GitHub and Codeberg, and both forges run the same
gates. The two configurations are kept deliberately parallel: a change that
passes on one and fails on the other is a bug in the pipelines, not a
property of the forge.

| Gate | GitHub Actions | Woodpecker (Codeberg) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fmt, clippy, unit tests, book | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`test`) | `.woodpecker/ci.yaml` |
| MSRV | `ci.yml` (`msrv`) | `.woodpecker/ci.yaml` (`msrv` step) |
| Live PostgreSQL suite | `ci.yml` (`database`) | `.woodpecker/database.yaml` |
| Advisories, licenses, SBOM | `ci.yml` (`supply-chain`) | `.woodpecker/supply-chain.yaml` |
| TLS-only PostgreSQL | `ci.yml` (`tls-database`) | — (see below) |
| Tag → artifacts | `.github/workflows/release.yml` | `.woodpecker/release.yaml` |
| crates.io | `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (manual) | — |

## What actually gates a merge

The unit-test job passes with no database and no FHIR specification packages
present, because the corpus- and spec-driven tests skip themselves when their
inputs are absent. That is convenient locally and misleading in CI, so the
live-database pipeline is a separate required gate rather than an optional
extra: most of fhirpg's guarantees are database guarantees — snapshot
isolation, advisory locks, the append-only trigger, the hash chain, and
index-using search plans — and none of them are exercised without a server.

The live pipeline downloads the FHIR definitions and example corpora from
hl7.org on each run. That is a network dependency on a third party, and it
will occasionally be the reason a build is red.

## The TLS gate, and why it is GitHub-only

fhirpg refuses a networked bind over a plaintext database link, and its
`require` validates the server certificate where libpq's does not. Neither
claim is worth much against a server that happily accepts plaintext, so one
job runs the live suite against a PostgreSQL configured `hostssl`-only —
and first proves the server really does refuse a plaintext connection, since
a gate that silently permits downgrade tests nothing.

This has no Woodpecker counterpart yet. Woodpecker starts services before
workspace steps run, so a certificate generated in a step does not exist when
the database container boots, and the obvious workarounds (committing a test
key, or docker-in-docker) are each worse than the gap. Codeberg pushes are
therefore covered by every gate *except* this one.

## MSRV

`rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` is a promise to downstream users. Both forges
read that value and build on exactly that toolchain, because an unverified
MSRV breaks silently the first time anyone uses a newer language feature.

The job reads the version from the manifest rather than hard-coding it, so
raising the MSRV is a one-line change in one place.

## Releasing

Pushing a `v*` tag builds binaries, generates a CycloneDX SBOM, and attaches
both — with SHA-256 checksums — to a release on that forge. GitHub builds
five targets (Linux gnu/musl on x86-64, Linux on arm64, macOS on both
architectures); Woodpecker builds the statically linked musl target, which is
the one that runs anywhere.

The SBOM ships with the release rather than only with the CI run that
produced it: a component handling clinical data is part of someone's IEC
62304 file (spec O10.10), and a CI log ages out while a release artifact does
not.

**Tagging does not publish to crates.io.** A crates.io version is immutable —
it can be yanked but never replaced — so publishing is a manual workflow that
requires typing `publish` into a confirmation field, and it re-runs fmt,
clippy, and the full test suite before uploading anything. A tag is easy to
create by accident; an immutable published version is impossible to withdraw.

## Secrets

| Secret | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | GitHub `publish.yml` (environment `crates-io`) | crates.io upload |
| `codeberg_token` | Woodpecker `release.yaml` | attach artifacts to a Codeberg release |

Neither pipeline needs access to any database containing real data, and
neither should ever be given one.
